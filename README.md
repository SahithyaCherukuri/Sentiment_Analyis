Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of peopleâ€™s opinions,
sentiments, attitudes, and emotions expressed in written language. It is one of the most active
research areas in natural language processing and text mining in recent years. Its popularity is
mainly due to two reasons. First, it has a wide range of applications because opinions are central
to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviours. Whenever we need to
make a decision, we want to hear others opinions. Second, it presents many challenging research
problems, which had never been attempted before the year 2000. Part of the reason for the lack
of study before was that there was little opinionated text in digital forms.


Sentiment classification is a way to analyze the subjective information in the text and
then mine the opinion. Sentiment analysis is the procedure by which information is extracted
from the opinions, appraisals and emotions of people in regards to entities, events and their
attributes. In decision making, the opinions of others have a significant effect on customers ease,
making choices with regards to online shopping, choosing events, products, entities. The
approaches of text sentiment analysis typically work at a particular level like phrase, sentence or
document level.
